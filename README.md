Project Description
Let's apply our natural language processing knowledge to Twitter. Tweets are notoriously difficult, as they are shorter than most texts and usually have hard-to-parse content like hashtags, mentions, links and emoji.

Despite the difficulties, tweets are fun content, so in this notebook we'll take a look at classifying two prominent North American politicians. Can we determine if it is Donald Trump or Justin Trudeau based on just a tweet? Let's see!

Project Tasks
1. Tweet classification: Trump vs. Trudeau
2. Transforming our collected data
3. Vectorize the tweets
4. Training a multinomial naive Bayes model
5. Evaluating our model using a confusion matrix
6. Trying out another classifier: Linear SVC
7. Introspecting our top model
8. Bonus: can you write a Trump or Trudeau tweet?
